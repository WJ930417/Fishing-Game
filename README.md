# Fishing-g
The fishing game is set in the sea where has abundant fishes and a boat that can hook the fish.

The game is based on big-bang program in Racket language to create rules of moving images and key or mouse events. And the sound effects are built using racket/gui and rsound library.

The game is based on timed mode and the task is to hook the most fishes in 30 seconds. Getting fishes will give the player bonus time or cost more if you get the wrong fish:

Normal fish: +1 seconds;

Star fish: +10 seconds;

Bone fish: -10 seconds.

*Shark: Game over immediately.

Different fishes have diverse speed, size and probability of occurrence. And with the time passed, fishes will speed up to make the game harder.

The player uses three keys to control the boat:

-- with "left" and "right" arrow keys, the boat will move towards the direction.

-- with "down" key, the boat will send a hook down for the fish.

When the hook touch the fish, the fish will be hooked up and placed in the boat.

â€¢	Reason: By inspired of the orc game with different game characters and snake game controlling with arrow keys. I want to write a game of fishing that I uses to play when I was a child.
